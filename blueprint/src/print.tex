% This file makes a printable version of the blueprint

% The template version assume you want to use a modern TeX compiler
% such as xeLaTeX or luaLaTeX including support for unicode
% and Latin Modern Math font with standard bugfixes applied.
% It also uses expl3 in order to support macros related to the dependency graph.
% It also includes standard AMS packages (and their improved version
% mathtools) as well as support for links with a sober decoration
% (no ugly rectangles around links).
% It is otherwise a very minimal preamble (you should probably at least
% add cleveref and tikz-cd).

\section*{Preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preface}
In this exposition, we describe a excruciatingly detailed proof of the following theorem:
\begin{theorem*}
  For a finite dimensional and Galois field extension $K/F$, the relative Brauer group $\br(K/F)$ is isomorphic to the second group cohomology $\HH^{2}\left(\gal(K/F),K^{\star}\right)$.
\end{theorem*}

\paragraph{} The reason for the detailed-ness is because we are aiming to formalise the proof described in the following chapters; therefore the more details, the better. We apologise for the unconventional organisation in advance --- earlier chapters sometimes use results from later chapter. For our defence, we try to categorise all the results by topics and, since this is a formalisation project, we can guarantee the readers that there is no circular reasoning.
